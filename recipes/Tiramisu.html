        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat,
            stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.
</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.</li>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the
            ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.
</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
